		<p class="text-large">Free Play Sessions:</p>
		<p>
			Students of the Beginner Adult classes and Private Lessons are invited to the weekly Free Play sessions. 
		</p>
		<p>
			These free sessions are pure camaraderie and exploration. Open training sessions, or "jams", are great opportunities to go back to the roots of how parkour started: outside, unorganized, being challenged by friends, and being challenged with friends.

		<h2 class="text-center">What is Parkour?</h2>
		<div class="text-justify">
			<p>In a nutshell, parkour is a discipline of movement that focuses on self-improvement through creative use of the practitioner's surroundings.</p>
			<p>There are a few main ideas that make parkour stand out from other physical disciplines and sports.</p>
			<ul class="plain">
				<li>
					<h3><strong>Core Values</strong></h3> 
					<p class="text-center"><strong>Perseverance, Courage, Humility, Integrity, Respect</strong></p>
					<p>
						Traditional sports end at the sound of a buzzer, a certain score is reached, or when the opponent taps out. In parkour, the game never ends. With even occasional training and dedication, parkour's Five Core Values become part of your everyday life.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3><strong>Autonomy</strong></h3>
					<p>
						A parkour practitioner has no adversary or opponent to focus on. The only tools you need are the shirt on your back and a pair of shoes. The world is your playing field and your mind is your opponent. Parkour is a discipline that can be practiced in a completely individualistic manner, but it doesn't have to be.

		<h2 class="text-center">Our Group Classes</h2>
		<div class="text-justify">
			<p>
				Group classes are the heart and soul of any parkour community!
			</p>
			<p>
				It is certain that parkour is about individual development. But the parkour practitioner also knows that parkour is also about <strong>community, kinship, and camaraderie.</strong> The gathering and communal training of parkour practitioners is the catalyst for creating life-long friendships and the glue that holds the community together.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you're not fond of doing something alone or you learn best when there are others around to cheer you on, then our group classes are perfect for you.

			<p>
				Our group classes will be in full force beginning in October, 2015. In the meantime, please visit our <a href="{{$location.host()}}/classes">Classes</a> page!

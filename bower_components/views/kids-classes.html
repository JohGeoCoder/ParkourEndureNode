			It is a child's natural instinct to explore and discover. Parkour can help your child learn to do just that in a structured and goal-oriented way that is both fun and engaging.

		<p>
			I've seen children who have dragged their parents along, and parents who brought their kids to try something new. Undoubtedly parkour is a great way to spend time with your kids and to watch them grow!

			To set up group private lessons or solo private lessons, contact the head coach, John George. You can find his contact information on the <a href="{{$location.host()}}/contact">Contact Us</a> page.

		<div class="text-justify">
			<p>
				Here is your chance to have a qualified coach help you focus on a particular aspect of your fitness and health. Private lessons can focus on any particular health or fitness goal. Maybe you feel you're not quite ready to join the group classes. Or maybe you're an advanced practitioner looking to go above and beyond the group classes.
			</p>
			<p>A <a href="{{$location.host()}}/coaches">coach</a> will work with you on a one-to-one basis.</p>
			<p>
				The first step is to determine the practitioner's goals. The coach will then develop 
				a training program tailored specifically for the practitioner with their goals in mind.
				The third step is to develop a training schedule and stick to it!
			</p>
			<p>
				Once the training program is designed, the coach and the practitioner will work together
				to find a schedule that works the best for the practitioner and locations to implement program.

				Coaching is beneficial to pracitioners of all skill levels. Rarely does one push themselves to their full
				potential. Having a coach is a valuable asset to your training.
			</p>
			<p>
				In some cases, private lessons are great for those who want to check their fitness level before joining the
				group classes.
			</p>
			<p>
				In other cases, the group classes do not push the practitioner as much as they would like to be pushed. And private
				lessons are the solution to the pursuit of further knowledge.

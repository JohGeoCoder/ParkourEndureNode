		<h2>Free Training Sessions</h2>
		<p>
			These free sessions are pure camaraderie and exploration. Open training sessions, or "jams", are great opportunities to go back to the roots of how parkour started: outside, unorganized, being challenged by friends, and being challenged with friends.
		</p>
		<p>
			Everyone and Anyone is welcome, even complete beginners. Keep an eye on our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Scranton-Parkour-Fitness-Community/">Meetup Calendar</a> for these free sessions.
